ElevatedFormBuilder
===================

Form builder for Elevated Rails projects.

You must create  app/views/forms/_field and app/views/forms/_field_with_errors partials to use the TemplateFormBuilder

If you want to use multiple form builders with different templates, you can subclass TemplateFormBuilder and override template_without_error and template_with_error
